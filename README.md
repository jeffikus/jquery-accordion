jQuery Accordion Plugin
=====

# What is jQuery Accordion?

jQuery Accordion by [Jeffikus](http://jeffikus.com/ "Jeffikus") is the best WordPress plugin to create accordions filled with content. It uses the powerful jQuery UI library to accomplish this.

The plugin basically does the following:

* Allows an accordion of content to be added to a posts content, use the shortcode [jqueryaccordion] to insert it into a page

# Why on Github and not WordPress.org

[WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress") is where your finished plugins should go and yes, this plugin will be, however, this repository is for collaboration and allowing users to submit their own enhancements towards the plugin.

The main reason for hosting it on Github is so you can easily fork it for your own projects, and send pull requests for updates/suggestions!

# What can I do with jQuery Accordion?

Create accordions of any type of content you can think of ;-) just not accordions in accordions...no inception type stuff here please!

# How did you learn about this?

Credit must go to the following sites and people for making resources available:

* jQuery and jQuery UI - [jQuery UI Accordion](http://jqueryui.com/accordion/ "jQuery UI Accordion")
* The original jQuery accordion plugin that I wrote 4 years ago - not many people know that the plugin was my "audition" for my position at WooThemes.com - I owe a lot of my success to the work I put into it, may it rest in peace :)

# Roadmap and Ideas

* WordPress Settings API area
* Compressed Jquery libaries
* Hooks and filters
* Configurable options for Jquery UI theme, default content types, default taxonomy terms, choice for excerpt or content
* Widget with configurable options
* Drop in/Upload Custom jQuery UI theme
* Accordion builder - custom accordion
* shortcode editor button
* themes extension or bundled in the plugin (depends on size of themes)
* Support multiple accordions
